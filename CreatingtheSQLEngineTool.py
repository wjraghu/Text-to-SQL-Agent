# Creating the SQL Engine Tool

# Next, we create a tool that allows the agent to perform SQL queries on the table. This tool will be used by the agent to execute SQL queries and return the results as a string:

from smolagents import tool
@tool
def sql_engine(query: str) -> str:
   """
   Allows you to perform SQL queries on the table. Returns a string representation of the result
   The table is named 'receipts'. Its description is as follows:
       Columns:
       - receipt_id: INTEGER
       - customer_name: VARCHAR(16)
       - price: FLOAT
       - tip: FLOAT

   Args:
       query: The query to perform. This should be correct SQL
   """
   output = ""
   with engine.connect() as con:
       rows = con.execute(text(query))
       for row in rows:
           output += "\n" + str(row)
   return output
