# Building a Text-to-SQL Agent
A text-to-SQL agent is a system that converts natural language queries into SQL queries, executes them on a database, and returns the results. This approach is particularly useful for users who are not familiar with SQL syntax but need to interact with databases.

This setup allows the agent to convert natural language queries into SQL queries, execute them, and return the results. The agent can also handle more complex queries involving table joins by updating the tool's description and using a more powerful model.
